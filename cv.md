## Summary

Currently I am a student majoring in information systems and technology. I have always liked programming. I studied German at school and there were doubts that it would be very difficult without knowledge of English, but nevertheless I decided that I wanted to become a programmer. I began to actively study English and learned about the App RS School courses and decided to try it. I love studying and listening to music.
